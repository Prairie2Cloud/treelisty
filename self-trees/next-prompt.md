# TreeListy Self-Tree Prompt v1.1

## Mission
Build an improved self-tree that builds on v1.0, focusing on gaps identified and deeper analysis where v1.0 was superficial.

## Context Loading
1. Load self-tree v1.0 as reference
2. Review its Quality Assessment and Learnings sections
3. Address gaps identified

## Structure (Same 4 phases, refined focus)

### Phase 1: Features
Same 6 areas. NEW: Add usage frequency estimates (High/Medium/Low/Unknown) to each feature. Include competitive comparison where relevant.

### Phase 2: Architecture
Same 6 areas. NEW: Add performance benchmarks (actual measurements, not estimates). Include code complexity metrics where available.

### Phase 3: User Journey
NEW: Add user personas (Developer, PM, Researcher, Student) and map journey differences. Include actual user quotes if available from any feedback channel.

### Phase 4: Meta
Same structure. Compare to v1.0 explicitly. Track which v1.0 improvements were implemented.

## New Requirements for v1.1
1. **Benchmark performance** - Actually measure node counts where slowdown occurs
2. **Add analytics review** - If any usage data exists, incorporate it
3. **Track improvement implementation** - Which v1.0 suggestions were done?
4. **Deeper competitive analysis** - Compare 3 features to Notion, Workflowy, Roam
5. **Include accessibility audit** - WCAG compliance assessment

## Success Criteria (v1.1 specific)
- [ ] All v1.0 criteria met
- [ ] Performance claims backed by benchmarks
- [ ] At least 2 user personas defined
- [ ] Competitive comparison for 3 features
- [ ] Track record of v1.0 improvements implemented

## Focus Areas for v1.1

**Areas Needing Deeper Coverage:**

1. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - v1.0 claimed '200 nodes slows Canvas' without measurement
   - v1.1 should run actual benchmarks and report precise thresholds

2. **User Research**
   - v1.0 User Journey is developer-assumed, not user-validated
   - v1.1 should incorporate any available user feedback

3. **Competitive Positioning**
   - v1.0 didn't compare to alternatives
   - v1.1 should benchmark against Notion, Workflowy, Roam

4. **Accessibility**
   - v1.0 didn't assess accessibility
   - v1.1 should include WCAG audit

5. **Pattern Usage**
   - v1.0 listed 21 patterns without usage data
   - v1.1 should estimate or measure pattern popularity

6. **Mobile Experience**
   - v1.0 mobile assessment was theoretical
   - v1.1 should include actual mobile testing results
