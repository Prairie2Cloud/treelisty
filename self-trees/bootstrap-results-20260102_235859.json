      "response": "Looking at your current Architecture Quick Reference, it's a good start but missing several critical pieces for AI developer onboarding:## 🚨 Missing Critical Info:ENTRY POINTS:- Main application file/class structure- How commands are registered and dispatched- Where AI wizard integration hooks inDATA FLOW:- How tree changes propagate between views- State management patterns (Redux? Vuex? Custom?)- Event system for cross-component communicationAI INTEGRATION:- Where LLM calls happen (`research:`, `open_wizard`, etc.)- API key management and configuration- How AI responses get parsed into tree operationsDEVELOPMENT SETUP:- Build system (Webpack? Vite? Rollup?)- Dev server and hot reload setup- Testing framework and command patterns## 🎯 What I'd Add:```• Command System: How functions like view_gantt() and research: are implemented• State Architecture: Tree data → View rendering pipeline  • AI Integration Points: Where GPT/Gemini calls happen• Build & Dev Setup: npm scripts, bundler, local development• Key Files Map: main.js, tree-model.js, ai-wizard.js locations```Quick Question: Is TreeListy built with a specific framework (React, Vue, vanilla JS) or is it framework-agnostic? That's usually the first thing developers need to know.This would transform it from a feature list into an actual technical roadmap for contributors.",
