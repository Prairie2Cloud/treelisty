PHASE 2 STATUS:

Given the complexity of completely rewriting the header (111 lines of HTML, preserving all IDs, event listeners, etc.) and current token usage (114k/200k), I recommend:

OPTION A: Simpler Phase 2 for this session
- Add theme system (DONE)
- Add a "More Tools" collapsible secondary toolbar
- Reduces visible buttons from 21 to ~8
- Faster to implement and test

OPTION B: Full dropdown redesign (next session)
- Complete header restructure
- 3 dropdown menus (File, AI, Settings)
- Reduces to 6 controls total
- Requires careful migration, testing

RECOMMENDATION: Ship Option A now (themes + simple toolbar collapse), then do Option B in next focused session when we have full token budget.

User preference needed.
